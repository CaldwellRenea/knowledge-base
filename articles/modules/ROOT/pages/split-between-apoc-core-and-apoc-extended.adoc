With the release of Neo4j version 5, the APOC library has been split into two: https://neo4j.com/docs/apoc/5/[APOC Core] and https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/5/[APOC Extended]. 


== APOC Core 

APOC was created to provide a standard utility library for common user-defined procedures.
It was not, however, maintained by Neo4j.  

With the release of Neo4j 5, this has changed. The majority of APOC procedures are now supported and maintained by Neo4j engineers. These supported procedures constitute the APOC Core library. 

For more details about APOC Core, see the https://neo4j.com/docs/apoc/5/[APOC Core documentation].


== APOC Extended

Procedures that fall outside the remit of APOC Core are still available to users. 
These procedures constitute APOC Extended. 
Note that the procedures in the APOC Extended library are not supported by Neo4j. 

For more details about APOC Extended, see the https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/5/[APOC Extended documentation].
